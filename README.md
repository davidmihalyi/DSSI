# DSSI
On 19th June 2020, WB released new debt data on the 72 countries  eligible for the 2020 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).

I scraped the 72 country tables, combined them and cleaned it up.
This enables to compare how significant debt servicing due towards various lenders are in 2019-2024 period.
